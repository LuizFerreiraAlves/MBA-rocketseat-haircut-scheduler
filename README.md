Runs this project locally.

On the root of your directory run:

npm run build
npm run server 
npm run dev

The first command bundles the HTML, CSS, JS and asset contents via webpack.
The second command starts an instance of json-server to mock API calls to your database.
The third command starts the front-end locally.
